# Terminology
Stablecoin : A stablecoin is a class of cryptocurrencies that attempt to offer price stability and are backed by a reserve asset.  
- how to create stablecoin:
  - offchain (centralized), collateral 抵押品 [fiat 法令, precious metal]
  - onchain (decentralized), collateral 抵押品 [crypto assets]
  - algorithmic (non-collateral) stable coin

Liquidation 清算
De-leveraging 去杠杆化。在期货市场上，交易者利用债务或杠杆来交易更大的资本。例如，币安允许交易员使用初始资本的125倍进行交易。如果用户有1000美元，用户最多可以用125000美元进行交易。  


# CeFi
Banks, securities/insurance/trust investment/fund management companies, etc. (title 31 of the United States Code)


# DeFi
DeFi : **Financial infrastructure as an open , permissionless, and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart constract platforms.**  
- DeFi
  - tokenization : process of adding new assets to blockchain.  
  - token : the blockchain representation of the asset.  
  - Governance token, security token (tokenized real estate), Non-fungible token (NFT), stablecoin   

- Key property of Decentralized finance:
  - non-custodical : user has full control of financial assets
  - transaction execution : no-one can single-handedly censor a transaction execution
  - protocol governance : no-one can single-handedly censor the protocol execution

- DeFi advatanges:
  - Efficiency
  - Transparency
  - DeFi applications often are much simpler and faster to develop than CeFi counterparts
    - E.g., Uniswap vs. CEX
  - Atomic composability
    - E.g., Flash loan 

# DeFi vs CeFi
| CeFi | DeFi |
| -- | -- |
| Permissioned | Permissionless |
| Custodial | Non-custodial |
| Centralized trust & governance | Decentralized trust & governance, Trustless |
| Real identity | privacy |


# DeFi stack
DeFi is enabled by a decentralized smart contract platform.

## Decentralized exchange
- CEX : centralized exchange
  - Custodial , Ex: coinbase
- DEX : decentralized exchange
  - Non-custodial, Transparency. Ex: uniswap


- DeFi Asset Tokenization
  - Tokenization : process of adding new assets to a blockchain
  - Token : the blockchain representation of the asset
    - Nonfungible token (NFT)
    - stablecoin
    - Governance token
    -  security tokens (tokenized real estate)


## Decentralized lending
lending / loan 借贷
- Collateralized loans in DeFi

- Over collateralization; not based on credit
  - Collateralized debt positions: creating new tokens using collateral
    - E.g., MakerDAO
  - Collateralized debt markets:
    - Pooled collateralized debt markets: e.g., Compound, Aave
    - P2P collateralized debt markets

- Under collateralization

- Lending in *CeFi*
  - Processing default is expensive; under-collaterization
  - Credit-worthiness

- Flash Loans
  - Blockchains enable atomic transactions
  - Pools lend assets within one transaction

# Risks in DeFi
- DeFi Security
  - network attack
  - consensus attack
  - smart contract code bugs
  - DeFi Protocol Composability attacks
  - Bridge attacks
  - Governance attacks
  - Technical structure security
  - Economic incentive security

- Defi Privacy
  - Blockchains with DeFi are mostly pseudonymous, not anonymous.
  - No privacy. Balances, transactions, timestamps, amounts are all public.


## Open Research Challenges
- Scalability : too expensive to use  
- universal accessibility , usability   
- privacy (privacy with compliance)  
- security  
- Legal framework

automated market maker (AMM)    
Uniswap is a decentralized application, or dapp, built on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s a smart contract that facilitates token trades between different parties.
